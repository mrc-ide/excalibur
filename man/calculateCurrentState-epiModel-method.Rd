\title{An S4 method to calculate current state of an object of the epiModel class}
\usage{
\S4method{calculateCurrentState}{epiModel}(epiModel, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{epiModel}{The epidemic model, whose current state is to be calculated.}

\item{...}{Any other arguements to provide to the method.}
}
\value{
An epiModel of object of the same class as that given.
}
\description{
Calls two generic functions to calculate the downstream nodes and esimate
the infectious population in turn. These will be specific to each type of
epiModel class.
}
\examples{
#set up model
model <- setSIR(N = 100, Beta = 1, Gamma = 1/5, ProbOfDeath = 0.5, I0 = 1)
#Set the deaths
deaths <- 20
#calculate current state
model <- calculateCurrentState(model, deaths)
#return the current state
currentState(model)
}
